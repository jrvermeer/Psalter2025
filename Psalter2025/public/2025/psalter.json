      "This His word shall be made known,\nThis Jehovah's firm decree:\nThou art my beloved Son,\nYea, I have begotten Thee.\nAll the earth at thy request\nI will give Thee for Thy own;\nThen Thy might shall be confessed\nAnd Thy foes be overthrown.",
      "Therefore, kings, be wise, give ear;\nHearken, judges of the earth;\nLearn to serve the LORD with fear,\nMingle trembling with your mirth.\nKiss the Son, lest o'er your way\nHis consuming wrath should break;\nBut supremely blest are they\nWho in Christ their refuge take."
