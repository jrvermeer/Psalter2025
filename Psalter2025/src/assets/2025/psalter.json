      "That man is blest who, fearing God, \nFrom sin restrains his feet, \nWho will not stand with wicked men, \nWho shuns the scorners\u0027 seat.",
      "Yea, blest is he who makes God\u0027s law \nHis portion and delight, \nAnd meditates upon that law \nWith gladness day and night.",
      "That man is nourished like a tree \nSet by the river\u0027s side; \nIts leaf is green, its fruit is sure, \nAnd thus his works abide.",
      "The wicked like the driven chaff \nAre swept from off the land; \nThey shall not gather with the just, \nNor in the judgment stand.",
      "The Lord will guard the righteous well, \nTheir way to Him is known; \nThe way of sinners, far from God, \nShall surely be o\u0027er-thrown."
