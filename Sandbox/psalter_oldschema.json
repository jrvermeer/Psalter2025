My prayer to God shall still be raised\nWhen troubles thick around me close;\nThe Lord, most worthy to be praised,\nWill rescue me from all my foes. \n\n3. When, floods of evil raging near,\nDown nigh to death my soul was brought,\nI cried to God in all my fear;\nHe heard and great deliverance wrought. \n\n4. He came: the earth's foundations quake,\nThe hills are shaken from their place,\nThick smoke and fire devouring break\nIn anger dread before His face. \n\n5. Descending through the bending skies,\nWith gloom and darkness under Him,\nForth through the storm Jehovah flies\nAs on the wings of cherubim. \n\n6. Thick darkness hides Him from the view,\nAnd swelling clouds His presence veil,\nUntil His glorious light breaks through\nIn lightning flash and glistening hail. \n\n7. Jehovah's thunders fill the heaven,\nThe dreadful voice of God Most High;\nWith shafts of light the clouds are riven,\nHis foes, dismayed, in terror fly. \n\n8. The raging torrents overflow,\nAnd sweep the world's foundations bare,\nBecause Thy blasts of anger blow,\nO Lord of earth and sea and air. \n\n9. He took me from the whelming waves\nOf bitter hate and sore distress;\nThe Lord, my stay and helper, saves,\nThough mighty foes around me press. \n\n10. From direful straits He set me free,\nHe saved the man of His delight;\nFor good the Lord rewarded me,\nBecause I kept His ways aright.",

My people, give ear, attend to my word,\nIn parables new deep truths shall be heard;\nThe wonderful story our fathers made known\nTo children succeeding by us must be shown.\n\n2. Instructing our sons we gladly record\nThe praises, the works, the might of the Lord,\nFor He hath commanded that what He hath done\nBe passed in tradition from father to son.\n\n3. Let children thus learn from history's light\nTo hope in our God and walk in His sight,\nThe God of their fathers to fear and obey,\nAnd ne'er, like their fathers, to turn from His way.\n\n4. The story be told, to warn and restrain,\nOf hearts that were hard, rebellious, and vain,\nOf soldiers who faltered when battle was near,\nWho kept not God's covenant nor walked in His fear.\n\n5. God's wonderful works to them He had shown,\nHis marvelous deeds their fathers had known;\nHe made for their pathway the waters divide,\nHis glorious pillar of cloud was their guide.\n\n6. He gave them to drink, relieving their thirst,\nAnd forth from the rock caused water to burst;\nYet faithless they tempted their God, and they said,\nCan He Who gave water supply us with bread?\n\n7. Jehovah was wroth because they forgot\nTo hope in their God, and trusted Him not;\nYet gracious, He opened the doors of the sky\nAnd rained down the manna in richest supply.\n\n8. With bread from on high their need He supplied,\nAnd more did He do when thankless they sighed;\nThe strong winds commanding from south and from east,\nHe sent them abundance of quail for their feast.\n\n9. Though well they were filled, their folly they chose,\nTill God in His wrath o'erwhelmed them with woes;\nHe slew of their strongest and smote their young men,\nBut still unbelieving they sinned even then.\n\n10. Because of their sin He smote with His rod,\nAnd then they returned and sought for their God;\nTheir Rock and Redeemer was God the Most High,\nYet false were their praises, their promise a lie.\n\n11. Not right with their God in heart and in will,\nThey faithlessly broke His covenant still;\nBut He, in compassion, reluctant to slay,\nForgave them and oft turned His anger away.\n\n12. His pity was great, though often they sinned,\nFor they were but flesh, a swift passing wind;\nYet though His compassion and grace they beheld,\nThey tempted and grieved Him and often rebelled.\n\n13. They limited God, the Most Holy One,\nAnd hindered the work His grace had begun;\nThe hand that was mighty to save they forgot,\nThe day of redemption remembering not.\n\n14. Ungrateful and blind, no longer they thought\nOf wonders and signs and mighty deeds wrought,\nOf how all the rivers of Egypt ran red,\nAnd plagues in God's anger were heaped on their head. \n\n15. They thought not of how, their freedom to gain,\nIn Egypt's abodes the first-born were slain,\nAnd how all God's people were led forth like sheep,\nThe flock He delighted in safety to keep.",

For, how great a God, and glorious,\nIs Jehovah Whom we sing;\nOver idol-gods victorious,\nGreat is He, our God and King.\nIn His hand are earth's deep places,\nHis the strength of all the hills,\nHis the sea whose bounds He traces,\nHis the land His bounty fills.\n\n3. To the Lord, such might revealing,\nLet us come with reverence meet,\nAnd, before our Maker kneeling,\nLet us worship at His feet.\nHe is our own God and leads us,\nWe the people of His care;\nWith a shepherd's hand He feeds us\nAs His flock in pastures fair.\n\n4. While He proffers peace and pardon\nLet us hear His voice today,\nLest, if we our hearts should harden,\nWe should perish in the way;\nLest to us, so unbelieving,\nHe in judgment shall declare:\nYe, so long My Spirit grieving,\nNever in My rest can share.",

His stern command restrained their foes\nAnd filled them with alarm:\nTouch not My own anointed ones,\nNor do my prophets harm.\n\n8. He wholly broke the staff of bread\nAnd called for famine sore,\nAnd He prepared His people's way\nBy sending one before.\n\n9. Then Joseph, sold to slavery,\nWith cruel chains was bound;\nTill his prediction came to pass,\nDistress and grief he found.\n\n10. The king released him from his bonds\nAnd made him rule the land,\nSubjecting chiefs and senators\nTo his controlling hand.\n\n11. To Egypt Israel followed then,\nAnd there grew great and strong,\nUntil their friends became their foes\nAnd did them grievous wrong.\n\n12. God sent His servant Moses then,\nAnd Aaron, whom He chose;\nGreat signs and wonders they displayed\nTo terrify their foes.\n\n13. In darkness they were taught to fear\nGod's great and holy Name;\nOn man and beast, on vine and field,\nHis awful judgment came.\n\n14. He smote the firstborn in the land,\nThe chief of all their strength,\nEnriched His people with the spoil\nAnd brought them forth at length.\n\n15. He led them forth in health and strength,\nNone weak in all their band,\nAnd Egypt, filled with fear, rejoiced\nTo see them leave the land.\n\n16. He spread a cloud to cover them,\nMost glorious and bright,\nAnd made a fiery pillar shine\nTo give them light by night.\n\n17. At their request He sent them quails,\nAnd bread of heaven bestowed;\nAnd from the rock, to quench their thirst,\nThe living waters flowed.\n\n18. His sacred word to Abraham\nHe kept, though waiting long,\nAnd brought His chosen people forth\nWith joy and thankful song.\n\n19. The lands and toil of wicked men\nHe gave them to possess,\nThat they might keep His holy laws;\nJehovah praise and bless.",

From the land beyond the Jordan\nI bewail my misery;\nFrom the foothills of Mount Hermon,\nO my God, I think of Thee.\nAs the waters plunge and leap,\nDeep re-echoes unto deep;\nAll Thy waves and billows roaring\nO'er my troubled soul are pouring.\n\n5. But the Lord will send salvation,\nAnd by day His love provide;\nHe shall be my exultation,\nAnd my song at eventide.\nOn His praise e'en in the night\nI will ponder with delight,\nAnd in prayer, transcending distance,\nSeek the God of my existence.\n\n6. I will say to God, my fortress:\nWhy hast Thou forsaken me?\nWhy go I about in sadness\nFor my foes' dread tyranny?\nTheir rebukes and scoffing words\nPierce my bones as pointed swords,\nAs they say with proud defiance:\nWhere is God, thy soul's reliance?\n\n7. O my soul, why art thou grieving;\nWhy disquieted in me?\nHope in God, thy faith retrieving;\nHe will still thy refuge be.\nI shall yet through all my days\nGive to Him my thankful praise;\nGod, who will from shame deliver,\nIs my God, my rock, forever.",

Thy precepts have I hid within my heart,\nLest I should stray and fall into transgression;\nO teach Thou me and unto me impart\nThy statutes for a permanent possession.\nIn all Thy judgments Thou most righteous art;\nThy truth I praise in rapturous confession.\n\n5. O teach me, Lord, the way that I should go;\nThen shall Thy servant walk therein forever.\nGive understanding all Thy paths to know;\nThen shall I keep Thy law with zealous fervor.\nInstruct me in Thy perfect will and, lo,\nI shall observe it with my whole endeavor.\n\n6. O Lord, Thou art my portion and my lot;\nI said that I would keep Thy Word forever,\nThough to my sorrow I have oft forgot.\nWith all my heart I now entreat Thy favor:\nBe merciful to me and chasten not;\nAccording to Thy Word be Thou my Savior.\n\n7. O how I love Thy law! Yea, Thou canst see\nThrough all the day it is my meditation;\nBy Thy commandments, Lord, Thou madest me\nMore wise than all who seek my ruination.\nThy testimonies evermore shall be\nThe perfect source of all my inspiration.\n\n8. Thy Word is as a lamp unto my feet,\nA light upon my pathway unto heaven;\nI've sworn an oath, which gladly I repeat,\nThat I shall keep, as always I have striven,\nThy righteous judgments, holy and complete,\nWhen unto me Thy helping grace is given.\n\n9. Great peace have they who love Thy perfect law;\nThey shall not swerve from paths of consecration;\nTheir happiness shall be without a flaw.\nLord, I have ever hoped for Thy salvation;\nAll Thy commandments I have kept with awe;\nThe precepts are my daily meditation.\n\n10. Grant life unto my soul, O Lord, I pray;\nShed still the brightness of Thy presence o'er me;\nThen shall I praise Thee in a perfect way,\nYea, let Thy judgments quicken and restore me.\nThy servant like a sheep has gone astray,\nYet Thy commandments I will keep before me.",
